Project Overview

This project creates a web application using Streamlit to find similarities between different columns in tables from a PostgreSQL database. 
The similarities are determined using MinHash and LSH (Locality-Sensitive Hashing) techniques. This app allows users to input database credentials, 
connect to a database, and then adjust shingle length and matching thresholds to compute similarities between tables.
